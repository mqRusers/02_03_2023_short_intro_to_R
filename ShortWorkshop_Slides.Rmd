## Why R and RStudio?

- It is free and open-source (unlike Minitab or Excel)

- It runs on many desktop platforms (Mac, PC, Unix, Linux)

- There are lots (> 10,000) of packages available to increase functionality (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)

- It runs many different statistical tests (far more powerful than Minitab or Excel)

- R lets you automate data processing

- It enforces scientific reproducibility because analyses are specified using
a scripting language that fully documents all of the steps

- Once you learn the language, it will save you lots of time

- R is a valuable skill that will increase or employability after graduation


## What is the difference between R and RStudio?

- **R** is a programming language that can be used to perform data processing
and analyses, and to create graphs.

\hfill

- **RStudio** is a separate program that provides a "front end" to R. It makes
using R easier by organising commands, scripts, graphics, help, etc. as separate
windows.

## R involves specifying arguments to functions and assigning outputs to objects
